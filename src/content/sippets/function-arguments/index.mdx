It's useful to know how to access the arguments passed into a function. This information is handy when functions are called with more arguments than they are formally declared to accept.  This technique is useful for functions that can be passed a variable number of arguments, such as Math.min(). we don't know how many arguments have been passed, or when we need to apply this data to the parameters of another function.



In Javscript, we have access to function arguments through the object `arguments`.

*DEMO HERE*

Arrow functions do not have an own arguments binding in their scope; no arguments object is created when calling them.

However, if you do want to capture the args for your arrow function, you can simply use a rest parameter

*DEMO HERE*


These objects are array<i>like</i> and contain the ordered values of the arguments passed into a function.
This object has a `length` property, and values can be accessed via index, as with arrays.

However, `arguments` does not have any of the built-in array methods such as map(), filter(), splice() etc.

This does not mean that we cannot convert `arguments` into an array.

Using ES6, we can do this easily using the `spread` operator:

* DEMO HERE*


Rest parameters can be combined with other positional parameters, but must always be included as the last parameter

const myFunc = (a, b, c, ...rest) =>
  console.log (a, b, c, rest)

myFunc (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
// 1 2 3 [ 4, 5, 6, 7 ]


let b = (...rest) => console.log(...rest)
let b = (...rest) => console.log(rest)
