In Javscript, we have access to function arguments through the object `arguments`.


*DEMO HERE*

The arguments object is not available in an arrow function. Arrow functions do not have an own arguments binding in their scope; no arguments object is created when calling them.

However, if you do want to capture the args for your arrow function, you can simply use a rest parameter

*DEMO HERE*


These objects are array<i>like</i> and contain the ordered values of the arguments passed into a function.
This object has a `length` property, and values can be accessed via index, as with arrays.

However, `arguments` does not have any of the built-in array methods such as map(), filter(), splice() etc.

This does not mean that we cannot convert `arguments` into an array.

Using ES6, we can do this easily using the `spread` operator:

* DEMO HERE*


Rest parameters can be combined with other positional parameters, but must always be included as the last parameter

const myFunc = (a, b, c, ...rest) =>
  console.log (a, b, c, rest)

myFunc (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
// 1 2 3 [ 4, 5, 6, 7 ]


let b = (...rest) => console.log(...rest)
let b = (...rest) => console.log(rest)
