As I've been working more with Gatsby and styled-components, I've run across an issue with flashes of unstyled content showing on page load and refresh in an application deployed to Netlify. Squashing this required a bit of exploration.

Here are the two steps that eventually fixed my problem:

1. Install the `gatsby-plugin-styled-components` `styled-components` `babel-plugin-styled-components` plugins and update the `gatsby-config.js` file (example below). I had only imported `styled-components` library, not knowing the other packages were needed.

This corrected the majority of issues I was having on page refresh. However, the unstyled font flicker was a little tricker to fix. After some experimentation I finally discovered that the `gatsby-plugin-typograpy` package did the trick.

2. Install the `gatsby-plugin-typography`, `react-typography` and `typography` packages and update the `gatsby-config.js` (also below) in order to fix font issues.

This involves creating a `src/utils` folder, with a `typography.js` file. In order to use Google fonts, the typography file required some configurations.

Here's mine:

import Gist from "react-gist"

<Gist id="d90e9831710cd398b3c1d251dea9761a" file="typography.js"></Gist>

Despite not setting the `Bai Jamjuree` font to either `headerFontFamily` or `bodyFontFamily`, I was able to use it elsewhere in my application.

Here's my `gatsby-config.js` file:

<Gist id="6e1e0a62f0c4b37b25424e9f0160ee30" file="gatsby-config.js"></Gist>


Hope this helps!
