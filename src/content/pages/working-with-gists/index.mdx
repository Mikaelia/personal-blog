I really enjoy working with Github gists. They have a nice look without having to tinker with themes (such as with Prism), are highly readable, and provide out-of-the-box syntax highlighting and line numbering for numerous languages and formats.

I also like having all of my code snippets stored in one central place. Whenever I need to reference or update them again, it's easy.

For these reasons, I wanted to use gists for writing blog posts. As things are, I ran into some roadblocks along the way. 

My first plan of attack was the
[gatsby-remark-embed-gist](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-embed-gist/) plugin. I spent a good chunk of time trying to get this to work, but was only ever able to render
the literal code block:

 `gist:Mikaelia/1234567#example-file.js`. 

By this time, I was investigating transitioning to MDX files.

 As written in the docs: 
> MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents.
> You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.
> This makes writing long-form content with components a blast ðŸš€.

Having the freedom to write JSX into my markdown sounded great, and it would open the door for writing more visual and potentially interactive content in the future. 

In addition, I had recently come across `react-gist`. This package provides the user with a gist component. This would serve as a perfect use-case for a MDX file, and would solve my gist rendering problem.

Once I had `gatsby-plugin-mdx` set up properly, all I needed to do was import, and include my gist components wherever I needed them:

import Gist from "react-gist"

<Gist id="fb695cda0d12970e932d105a83c79d91"></Gist>

Easy!

## Gotchas

- Do not forget the quotes around your `id` string else your gist will not render

- Please be aware that if you are using a frontmatter, you will need to include your import statement <i>after</i> the frontmatter. 

- If you are experiencing errors, be sure to try clearing your `.cache` and `public` folders by running `gatsby-clean.
